For this Mini exercise we spend a lot of time thinking of how we wanted to portrait language and code. We thought a lot about language and how it is a construction of letters and when these letters are put into words another person that speaks the same language can create an understand form it. So we created a program where the user needs to press any key with a letter that are found in the English alphabet. When a certain key is pressed the letter will appear on the screen while a voice from an audio-file is reading the letter out loud. 

It is really difficult to express yourself through our program and it is a great way of illustrating that language is so mush more that just letters. You need to put the letters together in the right way to make yourself understandable. The program is a way of showing that language is a code, where you need to put the right letters together to make a sound the receiver can understand. Your brain is in this way the computer and your voice is a tool that is used to express the codes your brain creates.
